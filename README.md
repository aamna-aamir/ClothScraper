ClothScraperÂ is a web scraping project that extracts data from various clothing websites, including H&M, Aritzia, and Ardene. 
The project aims to provide users with a comprehensive database of clothing items, including their prices, descriptions, images, material composition, and links to each product.
The data can be used for various purposes, such as price comparison, trend analysis, and fashion research.

#####the code:
The project is built using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, which is a popular tool for web scraping. The code accepts user input and generates URLs for the H&M, Aritzia, and Ardene search pages based on the input. It then extracts the first 10 products from each page for our webscraping purposes.
The code is designed to be modular and easy to use, allowing users to customize the scraping process to fit their needs. The scraped data is stored in a CSV file,
which can be easily imported into other applications for further analysis.
